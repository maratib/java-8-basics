# Introduction to Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that is focused on asynchronous data streams and the propagation of change. It provides a declarative way to model interactions and is especially well-suited for building scalable, resilient, and responsive applications.

## Core Concepts of Reactive Programming

This section introduces the fundamental ideas behind reactive programming, including the nature of data streams and the key abstractions used to handle them.

1. **Data Streams:**

   - A sequence of ongoing events ordered in time.
   - Can be anything: user inputs, API calls, or even variables.
   - **Description:** Data streams form the backbone of reactive programming by providing a structured way to manage data flow asynchronously.

2. **Reactive Streams Specification:**

   - A standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backPressure.
   - Core interfaces:
     - `Publisher`: Emits data to subscribers.
     - `Subscriber`: Consumes the data emitted by a publisher.
     - `Subscription`: Manages the lifecycle of the subscription.
     - `Processor`: Acts as both publisher and subscriber.
   - **Description:** Defines the contract for handling streams in a reactive and consistent manner.

3. **Observables:**

   - Entities that emit data over time.
   - Subscribers listen to these emissions.
   - **Description:** Observables act as the primary sources of data in reactive programming.

4. **Operators:**
   - Transform, filter, or combine data streams.
   - Examples: `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`.
   - **Description:** Operators are tools to process and transform data streams declaratively.

### Learned Points:

- Reactive programming deals with streams and events.
- Core concepts include observables, subscribers, and operators.

## Types of Reactive Programming

Explore the different categories of reactive programming and their unique focus areas.

1. **Event-driven programming (EDP):**

   - Handles events like user actions or system events asynchronously.
   - **Description:** Suitable for user interfaces or systems reacting to external triggers.

2. **Data-driven programming (DDP):**

   - Propagates changes automatically to dependent components.
   - **Description:** Used in scenarios like updating UI components automatically when data changes.

3. **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP):**

   - Combines functional programming principles with reactive streams.
   - **Description:** Brings declarative functional techniques to reactive workflows.

4. **Reactive Extensions (Rx):**
   - Libraries like RxJava to implement reactive systems.
   - **Description:** A set of tools to simplify reactive programming using predefined abstractions and patterns.

### Learned Points:

- Reactive programming types include event-driven, data-driven, FRP, and Rx.
- RxJava is a popular library for reactive programming in Java.

## Reactive Programming Classes in Java

Details about the foundational classes that enable reactive programming in Java.

1. **Publisher:**

   - Emits data to `Subscriber`.
   - Example: `Flux` (multiple emissions), `Mono` (single emission) from Project Reactor.
   - **Description:** The source of data streams in a reactive pipeline.

2. **Subscriber:**

   - Consumes data emitted by a `Publisher`.
   - **Description:** Reacts to the data or signals sent by a publisher.

3. **Subscription:**

   - Manages the relationship between `Publisher` and `Subscriber`.
   - **Description:** Controls the flow of data and the lifecycle of the subscription.

4. **Processor:**

   - A hybrid that acts as both `Publisher` and `Subscriber`.
   - **Description:** Useful for cases where intermediate processing is needed.

5. **Operators:**
   - Transformations applied to streams.
   - **Description:** Enhance and modify streams dynamically during processing.

### Learned Points:

- Core reactive classes include `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, `Subscription`, and `Processor`.
- Project Reactor provides `Flux` and `Mono` as reactive implementations.

## Deep Dive into Mono and Flux

An in-depth explanation of `Mono` and `Flux`, their differences, and how to use them effectively.

### 1. **Mono:**

- Represents a single value or no value (empty).
- Suitable for scenarios where you deal with zero or one element.
- **Description:** Ideal for single asynchronous computations or responses.

**Example:**

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

public class MonoExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Mono that emits a single value
        Mono<String> mono = Mono.just("Hello, Mono!");

        // Subscribe to Mono
        mono.subscribe(
            value -> System.out.println("Received: " + value), // onNext
            error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),    // onError
            () -> System.out.println("Mono complete!")         // onComplete
        );
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- `Mono.just()` creates a Mono that emits a single value.
- `Mono.empty()` creates an empty Mono.
- Use `Mono` when you expect a single result or none.

### 2. **Flux:**

- Represents a stream of 0 to N elements.
- Useful for scenarios where multiple values are expected.
- **Description:** Designed for processing multiple asynchronous elements.

**Example:**

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class FluxExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Flux that emits multiple values
        Flux<String> flux = Flux.just("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date");

        // Transform and subscribe to Flux
        flux
            .filter(fruit -> fruit.startsWith("A"))
            .map(String::toUpperCase)
            .subscribe(
                fruit -> System.out.println("Received: " + fruit), // onNext
                error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),   // onError
                () -> System.out.println("Flux complete!")       // onComplete
            );
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- `Flux.just()` creates a Flux with predefined elements.
- `Flux.fromIterable()` creates a Flux from a collection.
- Use `Flux` when you expect a stream of data with 0 to N elements.

### Comparing Mono and Flux:

| Feature   | Mono          | Flux            |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Emissions | 0 or 1        | 0 to N          |
| Use Case  | Single result | Stream of data  |
| Examples  | API response  | Data collection |

### Learned Points:

- Use `Mono` for single-value or empty streams, and `Flux` for multi-value streams.
- Both provide rich operators for data transformation.

## Example: Reactive Programming in Java

A demonstration of combining `Mono` and `Flux` to handle different types of data streams.

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

public class ReactiveExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Mono example: Single-value emission
        Mono<String> mono = Mono.just("Hello, Mono!");
        mono.subscribe(value -> System.out.println("Mono: " + value));

        // Flux example: Multi-value emission
        Flux<String> flux = Flux.just("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date");
        flux
            .filter(fruit -> fruit.length() > 5)
            .map(String::toUpperCase)
            .subscribe(fruit -> System.out.println("Flux: " + fruit));
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Mono:** Emits a single greeting message.
2. **Flux:** Emits a stream of fruits, filters by length, and converts to uppercase.
3. **Subscriber:** Processes the data streams emitted by both Mono and Flux.

### Learned Points:

- Mono and Flux can coexist to handle different data stream requirements.
- Subscribers process and respond to emissions in real time.
