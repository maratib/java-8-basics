1. Dependency Injection (DI)
2. Contextual lifecycle management
3. Type-safe injection
4. Event-based communication
5. Interceptors and decorators
6. Stereotypes

## **3. What is the difference between CDI and traditional Java EE dependency injection?**

CDI provides advanced features such as contextual lifecycle management, producer methods, and event handling, whereas traditional DI in Java EE (e.g., `@EJB`) is limited to simpler injection scenarios and lacks contextual awareness.

## **4. What are the built-in CDI scopes?**

1. `@ApplicationScoped`
2. `@SessionScoped`
3. `@RequestScoped`
4. `@ConversationScoped`
5. `@Dependent`

## **5. What is the default scope in CDI?**

The default scope is `@Dependent`. It means the bean lifecycle is tied to the client that injects it.

## **6. What is a CDI Bean?**

A CDI Bean is a managed component that is instantiated, managed, and injected by the CDI container. It must follow certain rules, such as having a no-argument constructor.

## **7. What is the purpose of the `@Inject` annotation?**

The `@Inject` annotation is used to perform dependency injection, allowing the CDI container to provide the required dependency automatically.

## **8. Explain `@Qualifier` in CDI.**

`@Qualifier` is used to distinguish between multiple beans of the same type. Custom qualifiers can be defined to inject specific implementations.

## **9. What is the use of the `@Produces` annotation?**

The `@Produces` annotation is used to create producer methods, which define how to produce instances of a specific type for injection.

## **10. What is the difference between `@Inject` and `@Produces`?**

`@Inject` is used to inject dependencies into a consumer, whereas `@Produces` is used to create instances of a type that cannot be directly instantiated by CDI.

## **11. What is the role of `@ApplicationScoped`?**

`@ApplicationScoped` defines a bean with a lifecycle that spans the entire application. The same instance is shared across all requests and sessions.

## **12. What is `@RequestScoped`?**

`@RequestScoped` defines a bean with a lifecycle tied to a single HTTP request.

## **13. What is `@SessionScoped`?**

`@SessionScoped` defines a bean with a lifecycle tied to an HTTP session. The same instance is shared across multiple requests in the same session.

## **14. What is `@ConversationScoped`?**

`@ConversationScoped` defines a bean whose lifecycle can span multiple requests within a conversation, managed explicitly using `Conversation` API.

## **15. What is `@Dependent` scope in CDI?**

`@Dependent` means the lifecycle of the bean is tied to the lifecycle of the client that injects it. A new instance is created for each injection.

## **16. What is a CDI Interceptor?**

A CDI Interceptor is a mechanism to implement cross-cutting concerns, such as logging or security, by intercepting method calls.

## **17. How is an interceptor defined in CDI?**

An interceptor is defined using `@Interceptor` on a class and a corresponding interceptor binding annotation (e.g., `@Loggable`).

## **18. What is a Decorator in CDI?**

A Decorator is used to extend the functionality of a bean by wrapping it. It is annotated with `@Decorator`.

## **19. What is an event in CDI?**

Events in CDI allow beans to communicate in a loosely coupled manner using the `Event` interface.

## **20. How do you fire a CDI event?**

Use the `Event` interface to fire events:

```java
@Inject
Event<MyEvent> event;

event.fire(new MyEvent());
```

## **21. How do you observe a CDI event?**

Use the `@Observes` annotation:

```java
public void onEvent(@Observes MyEvent event) {
    // Handle event
}
```

## **22. What are Stereotypes in CDI?**

Stereotypes are annotations that group common annotations, making beans easier to define and manage.

## **23. Explain the concept of `@Alternative` in CDI.**

`@Alternative` is used to mark a bean as an alternative implementation, which can be enabled in `beans.xml`.

## **24. What is the purpose of the `@Vetoed` annotation?**

`@Vetoed` is used to exclude a class from being managed by CDI.

## **25. How do you define a custom scope in CDI?**

1. Define a scope annotation with `@NormalScope`.
2. Create a corresponding `Context` implementation.
3. Register it in `beans.xml`.

## **26. What is `InjectionPoint` in CDI?**

`InjectionPoint` is used to access metadata about the injection point, such as qualifiers or type.

## **27. How does CDI manage object lifecycles?**

CDI manages object lifecycles based on their scopes (e.g., `@RequestScoped` creates one instance per request, `@ApplicationScoped` creates one per application lifecycle).

## **28. How do you enable CDI in a Jakarta EE project?**

Include a `beans.xml` file in the `WEB-INF` or `META-INF` directory.

## **29. Can CDI inject non-bean classes?**

No, CDI can only inject managed beans or objects produced by producer methods.

## **30. What is a proxy in CDI?**

A proxy is a wrapper object used by CDI for beans with a scope wider than `@Dependent`. It ensures proper lifecycle and contextual references.

3. **Initialization**: The servlet is loaded and initialized.
4. **Execution**: The servlet processes requests.
5. **Destruction**: The servlet is removed from memory.

## 10. What is the role of `pageContext` in JSP?

`pageContext` is an implicit object that provides access to all JSP objects (request, response, session, etc.) and allows sharing data between them.

## 11. How can you handle exceptions in JSP?

- Use `errorPage` attribute to redirect to an error page.
  ```jsp
  <%@ page errorPage="error.jsp" %>
  ```
- In the error page, set `isErrorPage="true"`.
  ```jsp
  <%@ page isErrorPage="true" %>
  ```

## 12. What is the difference between `forward` and `sendRedirect`?

- **Forward**: Happens on the server side; the client is unaware.
- **SendRedirect**: Client-side redirection; the browser is redirected to a new URL.

## 13. What is JSTL?

## 12. **What is the purpose of `@Lock` in Singleton Beans?**

The `@Lock` annotation specifies concurrency control for Singleton Beans, with values like `@Lock(LockType.WRITE)` for exclusive access and `@Lock(LockType.READ)` for shared access.

## 13. **What is the difference between `@Timeout` and `@Schedule`?**

- **`@Timeout`:** Used in conjunction with a Timer Service to handle single or recurring timer expirations.
- **`@Schedule`:** Used for declarative, calendar-based scheduling in Singleton Beans.

## 14. **What is Dependency Injection in EJB?**

Dependency Injection simplifies resource lookup by automatically injecting required resources (like other beans, data sources) using annotations like `@EJB`, `@Inject`, or `@Resource`.

## 15. **What is the difference between local and remote EJB interfaces?**

- **Local Interface:** Used when the client and the EJB run in the same JVM.
- **Remote Interface:** Used when the client and the EJB run in different JVMs.

## 16. **What is an Interceptor in EJB?**

Interceptors are used to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, auditing) and are defined using `@Interceptor` and `@AroundInvoke`.

## 17. **What is EJB Timer Service?**

EJB Timer Service provides functionality to schedule timed events for EJBs, such as executing tasks at a specific time or interval.

## 18. **What is `EJBContext`?**

`EJBContext` provides access to container-related functionality, such as transaction management, security, and environment lookup.

## 19. **What is the role of `@Asynchronous` in EJB?**

The `@Asynchronous` annotation allows a method to execute asynchronously, returning control to the client immediately.

## 20. **How do you declare an EJB local interface?**

A local interface is declared using the `@Local` annotation.  
Example:

```java
@Local
public interface MyLocalInterface {
    void performTask();
}
```

## 21. **What is the purpose of `@PreDestroy` and `@PostConstruct`?**

- **`@PostConstruct`:** Called after the bean is initialized and dependencies are injected.
- **`@PreDestroy`:** Called before the bean is removed or destroyed.

## 22. **What is EJB Passivation?**

Passivation is the process of saving the state of a Stateful Session Bean to free up memory and restore it when needed.

## 23. **What is EJB Pooling?**

EJB Pooling is a mechanism where a pool of bean instances is maintained to handle multiple client requests efficiently, improving performance.

## 24. **How do EJBs integrate with JPA?**

EJBs can integrate with JPA to manage persistence. For example, an EJB can use `@PersistenceContext` to inject an EntityManager for database operations.

## 25. **What are the benefits of using EJBs?**

- Simplified development of distributed systems.
- Automatic transaction management.
- Security management.
- Scalability and high availability.
- Integration with Jakarta EE technologies.
