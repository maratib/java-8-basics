## 1. What is Docker?

`Docker is a containerization platform` that allows developers to package applications along with their dependencies into `lightweight, portable containers` that can run on any system.

## 2. What are the main components of Docker?

1. **`Docker Engine`**: The runtime for building and running containers.
2. **`Docker Images`**: Read-only templates used to create containers.
3. **`Docker Containers`**: Executable instances of Docker images.
4. **`Docker Hub`**: A cloud-based repository for sharing Docker images.
5. **`Docker Compose`**: A tool for defining and running multi-container applications.

## 3. How are Docker containers different from virtual machines?

- Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight.
- VMs have a full guest OS, making them heavier and slower to start.

## 4. What is a Docker image?

A Docker image is a read-only template that contains instructions for creating a container, including the application and its dependencies.

## 5. What is a Docker container?

A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image that runs in an isolated environment.
